Summary of the lab: The lab took a few more hours than the last one as some of the functions, especially matrixinverse() required many very specific actions. Overall the lab wasn't too difficult though.

Describe  your  approach  to  the  lab.  What  went  wrong  as  you  worked  through  it?  What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? Did you work with anyone else in the class? How did you work with them and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

A: Many of the functions flowed pretty easily actually and the biggest issue just came from understanding the arrays. Watching some videos online about pointers and dereferencing helped me better understand the lab.


oGive  us  some  feedback.    How  many  hours  did  you  end  up  spending  on  it?  What'd  you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the  points  distribution  for  the  grading  seem  appropriate?  Did  the  lab  manual  cover  the  material  in  enough  detail  to  start  you  off?  Did  examples  or  discussions  during  class  help  you  understand  this  lab  or  would  more  teaching  on  the  concepts  in  this  lab help?

A: I spent approximately six or seven hours on the lab in whole. I enjoyed that the functions were spelled out for us which was very helpful. I think my only issue with the lab was the matrixinverse function which proved to be extremly difficult to solve.
