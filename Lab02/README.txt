Q: What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes?  Why?
A: The program will accept one white space input and then will never accept another input and run forever. This is because, the variable storing the input never recieves an input.

Q: In  this  lab,  we  forbid  you  from  using  printf()  or scanf()  inside  of  certain  functions.  Explain why a rule like this is useful.
A: This is useful because if the input was acquired within a function, it would be much more difficult to get that variable and give it back to the main file, and then every other function that requires the input. 


Q: How long did this lab take you?  Was it harder or easier than you expected?
A: This lab took me approximately four to five hours and was harder than I expected. This is because of the embedded system which adds nuance to the programming, especially with the formatting. Debugging is much harder when uploading to the board everytime.
