Summary: 
This lab removed mplabx from our tool kit and pushed us towards software programming in C on systems with an OS. The game followed retro text adventure game format and dove into FILE IO.

Approach: 
A major chunk of this lab became finding the right software environment to program and compile in. On my windows 10 computer, I used the linux subsystem which allowed me to download UBUNTU, an open source UNIX OS, and run a bash terminal simulating the linux environment. The bash terminal gives access to all of the compiling tools needed, like gcc. 

Conclusion: 
Piecing the lab together proved to be difficult without a debugger. In the future, I would need to find a way of setting of a debugger in Visual Studio Code. After an abundance of segmentation fault errors, I eventually figured out how to read files well, and put the project together.
